Over the past year and a half, Dr. Pinto has put work into various projects and studies in order to examine physical therapy techniques, economy around healthcare, behaviors, and much more. He has also recieved funding for various projects and has had presentations throughout. 
  
  Our team consists of Dr. Pinto as the head researcher, Marissa Lovell as our research coordinator, and our student research assistants.
