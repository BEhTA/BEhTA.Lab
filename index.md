## Welcome to BEhTA Lab at Marquette University

  In 2017, Dr. Daniel Pinto became an assistant professor at Marquette Univeristy in the department of physical therapy, and brought his research projects with him. Over the past year and a half, Dr. Pinto has put work into various projects and studies in order to examine physical therapy techniques, economy around healthcare, behaviors, and much more. He has also recieved funding for various projects and has had presentations throughout. 
  Under Dr. Pinto, we have Ms. Marissa Lovell who is the research coordinator, and we are also made of student assistant researchers from the physical therapy program. 
   Take a look at our current projects going on and see what we have been up to.
